glitchy-userscript
==================

somebody else's greasemonkey glitch generator script that I seem to be obsessed with hacking on

found at http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/9653.html

initially got it working by adding the `@grant GM_xmlhttprequest`

but then found it was missing a lot of images on the page, and of course, in other iframes (ugh ads)

so, working on making it a little stronger

might just do bookmarklet, GM is kinda meh and browser-specific

todo why bother with xhr? why not just use canvas to take a picture and glitch that?
